        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

            A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
            In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
            HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also
            known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.
