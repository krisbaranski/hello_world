    <!--SEMANTIC HTML
Header and Nav
Let’s take a look at some semantic elements that assist in the structure of a web page. A header> is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing h1> to h6> headings.
By using a header> tag, our code becomes easier to read. It is much easier to identify what is inside of the h1>‘s parent tags, as opposed to a div> tag which would provide no details as to what was inside of the tag.

A nav> is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It is important to note that nav> can be used inside of the header> element but can also be used on its own.

    <header>
        <h1>Navigational Links</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#posts">Posts</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <!-- Main and Footer
Two more structural elements are main> and footer>. These elements along with nav> and header> help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards.

The element main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the footer> and the nav> of a web page since these elements don’t contain the principal content. By using <main> as opposed to a div> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

    As we see above, main> contains an article> and header> tag with child elements that hold the most important information related to the page.
The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the footer> element. The footer contains information such as:

- Contact information
- Copyright information
- Terms of use
- Site Map
- Reference to top of page links
