    <!--SEMANTIC HTML
Header and Nav
Let’s take a look at some semantic elements that assist in the structure of a web page. A header> is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing h1> to h6> headings.
By using a header> tag, our code becomes easier to read. It is much easier to identify what is inside of the h1>‘s parent tags, as opposed to a div> tag which would provide no details as to what was inside of the tag.

A nav> is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It is important to note that nav> can be used inside of the header> element but can also be used on its own.
-->

    <header>
        <h1>Navigational Links</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#posts">Posts</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <!-- Main and Footer
Two more structural elements are main> and footer>. These elements along with nav> and header> help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards.

The element main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the footer> and the nav> of a web page since these elements don’t contain the principal content. By using <main> as opposed to a div> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

    As we see above, main> contains an article> and header> tag with child elements that hold the most important information related to the page.
The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the footer> element. The footer contains information such as:

- Contact information
- Copyright information
- Terms of use
- Site Map
- Reference to top of page links
-->

    <!-- Article and Section
Now that we covered the body of Semantic HTML, let’s focus on what can go in the body. The two elements we’re going to focus on now are section> and article>.

section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single section>. A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.

The article> element holds content that makes sense on its own. article> can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An article> tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.

the article> element containing a fact about cricket was placed inside of the section> element. It is important to note that a section> element could also be placed in an article> element depending on the context.   
-->

    <section>
        <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2>
        <article>
            <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 5 days.</p>
        </article>
    </section>

    <!--  Aside element 
    
    The aside> element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. This element can be used alongside other elements such as article> or section>. Some common uses of the aside> element are for:

Bibliographies
Endnotes
Comments
Pull quotes
Editorial sidebars
Additional information
-->

    <article>
        <p>The first World Series was played between Pittsburgh and Boston in 1903 and was a nine-game series.</p>
    </article>
    <aside>
        <p>
            Babe Ruth once stated, “Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.”
        </p>
    </aside>
    <!-- Figure and Figcaption
With aside>, we learned that we can put additional information next to a main piece of content, but what if we wanted to add an image or illustration? That is where figure> and figcaption> come in.

figure> is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.

In this code, we created a figure> element so that we can encapsulate our img> tag. In figure> we used the img> tag to insert an image onto the webpage. We used the src attribute within the img> tag so that we can link the source of the image.

It’s possible to add a caption to the image by using figcaption>.

figcaption> is an element used to describe the media in the figure> tag. Usually, figcaption> will go inside figure>. This is different than using a p> element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of figure>, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a figcaption> will move with the figure. This is useful for grouping an image with a caption.-->

    <figure>
