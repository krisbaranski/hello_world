    <div class="container">
        <p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 100px;"> CSS declarations are structured into property
            and
            value
            pairs:<br>
            <br>- The <em>font-family</em> property defines the typeface of an element
            <br>- <em>font-size</em> controls the size of text displayed
            <br>- <em>font-weight</em> defines how thin or thick text is displayed
            <br>- The <em>text-align</em> property places text in the left, right,
            or center of its parent container
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 100px;">Text can have two different
            color
            attributes,
            <em>color</em> and <em>background-color</em>:
            <br>- <em>color</em> defines the color of the text,
            while <em>background-color</em> defines the color behind the text
            <br>CSS can make an element transparent with the <em>opacity</em> property
            <br> CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the
            <em>background-image</em>
            property
            <br>The <em>!important</em> flag will override any style,
            <br>however it should almost never be used, <br>as it is extremely difficult to override<br>
        </p>
    </div>


    <div id="imp" class="space">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">!Important</h1>
        <br>
        <p> <em>!important</em> can be applied to specific attributes instead of full
            rules. It will override any style no matter
            how specific it is. As a result, it should almost never be used. Once !important is used, it is very
            hard to override.
            Since !important is used on the p selector’s color attribute, all p elements will appear blue, even
            though there is a more specific .main p selector that sets the color attribute to red.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="flow" class="caption">
        <h1>Flow of HTML</h1>
        <p>A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to
            bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in
            HTML.

            In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that
            change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a
            page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

            In this lesson, you will learn five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the
            browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>position</li>
            <li>display</li>
            <li>z-index</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>clear</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used
            in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="position" class="position">
        <h1>Position</h1>
        <p>Block-level elements like boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they
            prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.<br>
            Notice the block-level elements take up their own line of space and therefore don’t
            overlap each other. In the browser you can see block-level elements also consistently appear on
            the left side of the browser. This is the default position for block-level elements.

            The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property
            can take one of four values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)</em></li>
            <li>relative</li>
            <li>absolute</li>
            <li>fixed</li>

        </ul>

        <p>If you favor the default position of an HTML element, you don’t need to set its
            position property.
        </p>

        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <p>This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page.
            Although the code in the example above instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the div, it
            does not specify where the div should be positioned on the page.In the example above, the
            div has been positioned using two of the four offset properties. The valid offset properties are:

            top - moves the element down.
            bottom - moves the element up.
            left - moves the element right.
            right - moves the element left.
            In the example above, the <em>div</em> will be moved down 20 pixels and to the right 50 pixels from its
            default static position. The image below displays the new position of the box. The dotted line represents
            where the statically positioned (default) box was positioned.
            Units for offset properties can be specified in pixels, ems, or percentages. Note that offset properties
            will not work if the value of the element’s position property is the default static.
