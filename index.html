Inline styles are a fast way of styling HTML, but they also have limitations. If you wanted to style, for example, multiple <h1> elements, you would have to add inline styling to each element manually.
    HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element. CSS can be written between opening and closing <style> tags. To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the <head> element.

    We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute by separating them with a space. This enables us to mix and match CSS classes to create many unique styles without writing a custom class for every style combination needed.-->

    <!-- Class Name
CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It’s also possible to select an element by its class attribute.

The paragraph element in the example above has a class attribute within the <p> tag. The class attribute is set to "brand". To select this element using CSS, we could use the following CSS selector:
    .brand { 
        }
-->
    <p class="brand">Sole Shoe Company</p>
    <!-- Id Name for individual element style
    
    If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element. To add an ID to an element, the element needs an id attribute
    Then, CSS can select HTML elements by their id attribute. To select an id element, CSS prepends the id name with a hashtag (#).
    The id name is large-title, therefore the CSS selector for it is #large-title.
    -->
    <h1 id="large-title"> Large Title </h1>

    <!--Classes and ID's, difference.
        CSS can select HTML elements by their tag, class, and ID. CSS classes and IDs have different purposes, which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements.

CSS classes are meant to be reused over many elements. By writing CSS classes, you can style elements in a variety of ways by mixing classes on HTML elements.

For instance, imagine a page with two headlines. One headline needs to be bold and blue, and the other needs to be bold and green. Instead of writing separate CSS rules for each headline that repeat each other’s code, it’s better to write a .bold CSS rule, a .green CSS rule, and a .blue CSS rule. Then you can give one headline the bold green classes, and the other the bold blue classes.

While classes are meant to be used many times, an ID is meant to style only one element. As we’ll learn in the next exercise, IDs override the styles of tags and classes. Since IDs override class and tag styles, they should be used sparingly and only on elements that need to always appear the same.-->
